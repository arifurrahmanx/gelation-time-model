### Cross-Linked and Responsive Polymer: Gelation Model and Review (data)
[![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/549833279.svg)](https://zenodo.org/badge/latestdoi/549833279)


This page contains data and reproduce script for our [manuscript](xxx), in which we use it as a dataset for the machine learning algorithm to predict the polymer gelation time.
The R squared fits the natural log of gelation time variation from the experiment and predicted models.
