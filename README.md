This page contains data and reproduce script for our [manuscript](xxx), in which we use it as a dataset for the machine learning algorithm to predict the polymer gelation time.
The R squared fits the natural log of gelation time variation from the experiment and predicted models.


Folder **Fig_5and6** is the .fig files for Figure 5 and Figure 6. It is the surface interactive plot between experimental and analytical model.
